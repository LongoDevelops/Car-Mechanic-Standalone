I made this script for people who need to fix their vehicle. This makes RP a lot better for vMenu servers and all around realism. I will update the script as time passes on. I am thinking on making one where you get out of the vehicle and do an emote or make it so only mechanics can fix the vehicle with the emote. This script is only for the Mechanic/gas station right next to the Sandy Airfeild. Developers can edit the code to add more to the script if they want.
